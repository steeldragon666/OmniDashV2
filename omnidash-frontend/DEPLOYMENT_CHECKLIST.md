- [ ] Backup current production (if exists)
- [ ] Notify team of deployment window

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 2. Run production tests
npm run test:production

# 3. Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# 4. Verify staging deployment
# Test all critical paths

# 5. Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# 6. Verify production deployment
# Run smoke tests
```

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all services are running

- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Update status page

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical errors in production
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Security breach detected
- Data corruption identified

### Rollback Process
1. [ ] Alert team immediately
2. [ ] Document issue
3. [ ] Execute rollback: `npm run rollback`
4. [ ] Verify previous version restored
5. [ ] Investigate root cause
6. [ ] Create hotfix if needed
